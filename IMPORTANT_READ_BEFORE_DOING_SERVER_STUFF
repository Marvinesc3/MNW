HEY GUYS THIS IS NITHIN. SOME IMPORTANT STUFF TO REMEMBER WHEN WORKING IN THE MULTIPLAYER FILE:

-NEVER DO ANY CANVAS STUFF IN THE SERVER.JS
-ANY CANVAS STUFF YOU DO WANT TO DO GOES IN GAME.JS
-THE PLAYER OBJECT IN THE SERVER.JS WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY IF YOU HAVE METHODS IN IT, SO USE STUFF LIKE BOOLEANS AND THEN DEFINE THE FUNCTION IN
 GAME.JS AND RUN IT IF THE CORRESPONDING BOOLEAN IS TRUE
-SOMEONE PLEASE FIX AN ISSUE THAT I HAD WITH THE IMAGE SHIP.PNG BEING IN THE BROKEN STATE. THE PROBLEM LINE SHOULD BE THE COMMENTED ON AT THE
 BOTTOM OF GAME.JS
-COLLISIONS NEED TO BE DONE, AS DO BULLETS
-DON'T MESS WITH THE SERVER OR THE NODE MODULES OR THE SOCKET IO FILE
-GAME.JS IS IN THE STATIC FILE...LEAVE IT IN THERE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO RUN THE SERVER:

-GO INTO THE DIRECTORY THAT THE PROJECT IS IN (ON TERMINAL OR CMD; THE COMMAND TO MOVE DIRECTORIES IS cd [directory name] [AND YOU CAN ONLY MOVE
 UP ONE DIRECTORY AT A TIME], AND MOVING BACK ONE IS cd..)
-GO INTO THE MULTIPLAYER TEST FOLDER (ON TERMINAL OR CMD)
-TYPE THE FOLLOWING EXACTLY INTO YOUR COMMAND PROMPT: node server.js
-GO INTO GOOGLE CHROME AND SEARCH THIS EXACTLY: localhost:5000
-YOU ARE NOW ON THE GAME
